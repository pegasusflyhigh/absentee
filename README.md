# Absentee
A lightweight attendance management system for Rural Schools in India.

## Statistics
Child trafficking is the third largest profitable industry of the world and India seems to be in the thick of it. India is not only the source, but a destination and transit point for this heinous crime.

180 children go missing on an average every day. While the number of children who go missing remains alarming, the number of untraced children keep piling year on year, says CRY Report

Maharashtra and Delhi have the maximum number of untraced children. According to a recent RTI reply from the Delhi Police, 22 children go missing in Delhi every day.

Trafficking in children is on rise, and nearly 60% of the victims of trafficking are below 18 years of age.


## The Incident
A girl in 6th/8th std was abducted from a school I know. In the eveninga after school hours, parents came inquiring at school why she dint return home; only to find that she never went to school that day. No body ever knew the whole story except that she was found raped and dead someplace in Utter Pradesh.

I since then learnt that maximum child-abduction happens during kids way to school because of the long hours that usually takes to realise the situation.

A simple alert to her parents saying that she’ve not reached the school, cud have saved that girl’s life.

Such alert systems are already implemented in big and small schools mostly in all cities.
Although, in schools at remote places, small towns and villages, this facility have still not reached.

Besides this extreme case, there are situations like kids bunking the school (of course without parents their parents know) and get themselves involved gambling and other wrong doings and get mixed with wrong sort of crowd.

I’ve interview parents who’ve beaten up their kids for getting involved in gambling instead of going to school. These parents had pleaded school authorities to inform them if their kid bunks the school. But that is no reliable way to address this issue in such places.
