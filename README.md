# Absentee
A lightweight attendance management system for Rural Schools in India.

## Statistics
Child trafficking is the third largest profitable industry of the world and India seems to be in the thick of it. India is not only the source, but a destination and transit point for this heinous crime.

180 children go missing on an average every day. While the number of children who go missing remains alarming, the number of untraced children keep piling year on year, says CRY Report

Maharashtra and Delhi have the maximum number of untraced children. According to a recent RTI reply from the Delhi Police, 22 children go missing in Delhi every day.

Trafficking in children is on rise, and nearly 60% of the victims of trafficking are below 18 years of age.


## The Incident
A girl in 6th/8th std was abducted from a school I know. In the eveninga after school hours, parents came inquiring at school why she dint return home; only to find that she never went to school that day. No body ever knew the whole story except that she was found raped and dead someplace in Utter Pradesh.

I since then learnt that maximum child-abduction happens during kids way to school because of the long hours that usually takes to realise the situation.

A simple alert to her parents saying that she’ve not reached the school, cud have saved that girl’s life.

Such alert systems are already implemented in big and small schools mostly in all cities.
Although, in schools at remote places, small towns and villages, this facility have still not reached.

Besides this extreme case, there are situations like kids bunking the school (of course without parents their parents know) and get themselves involved gambling and other wrong doings and get mixed with wrong sort of crowd.

I’ve interview parents who’ve beaten up their kids for getting involved in gambling instead of going to school. These parents had pleaded school authorities to inform them if their kid bunks the school. But that is no reliable way to address this issue in such places.

## Proposed Features & Technical Requirements:
* Classroom & Student updation via file upload (once a year). 
* Every year the class progresses but students could be demoted / promoted. 
* Students may be added / removed. 
* SMS sent only when the child is marked absent 
* Raise an SMS alert to an admin if the absence SMS’s aren’t sent within 2 hours after school started.
* High Latency and low bandwidth solution.
* Light-weight on browser / device with off-line sync capabilities.
* SMS provider integration


## HACKATHON RULES 
* Max Team size: 5
* Each team will be provided with 10 free SMS for testing their system via TextLocal (or we may look up another provider for free access) In some cases, we may help you out with paid TextLocal account for SMS testing.
* Sai, Neha (basically UX/UI)  will not be part of any team but you can run your ideas by them. 
* UX/UI is not as important as functionality. Winning team will get special attention (and rework) for the UX / UI from Sai & Neha
* You can plan your ideas, story, wireframes, build your assets (images, sketches etc.) but NO code until the hackathon starts. 
* Choose any language or framework 
* Deployment on AWS or Heroku
* Team will commit code to github.com/joshsoftware/attendance with the branch that is the teams name! “master” will be later merged with the winning team code! 

Be honest and have fun! 
* No writing code before the contest begins! 
* We shall be monitoring the frequency of commits to eliminate cheaters (who will be dealt with severely)
* Do NOT merge another teams' code for your development! :D 

## Winners
+ You will get to go to Nagpur to install this setup for a school and meet the teachers.
+ Travel and Stay will be taken care of by Josh! 
+ Amazon Gift Voucher of ₹ 3,000 for each participant of the team. 
+ We may present this to DigitalSeva (Government of India, who is our customer, for those who didn’t know) and get this propagated to all Rural schools in India!
